# thunderous-soldier

Thunderous Soldier is a paranoid [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) based [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) making use of [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) and [flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) algorithms to make predictions about the future state of the game. The snake evaluates all possible moves by ourselves and the enemy.
